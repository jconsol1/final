                With housing developments arising, new rails of transportation in the works, and
                roadway changes being implemented in the local area, the city of College Park is
                urbanizing and thriving like never before.

            <p style="text-align: left; width: 85%; margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 10px;">
                Since 2020, a series of housing development requests have been approved and put
                into action across the city.
            <br><br></p>
            <div style="background-color: white; width: 80%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; font-size: x-large;"><b>“Developers are practically beating our doors down with new student housing
                projects.” <br> - College Park Mayor, Patrick Wojahn.</b>
            </div>
            <p style="text-align: left; width: 85%; margin: 0 auto;">
                <br><br>
                According to Wojahn, the city is bringing these developments, in-part, to
                bring more student residents to the city. However, non-student residents are a
                priority as well, said Wojahn.
                <!--Juxtapose city's new housing developments under construction from 2020 to now-->
                <br><br>
                “It is critical to encourage more non-student residents to live in College Park, to
                ensure that our downtown commercial areas do well even in the summer when not
                as many students are around,” Wojahn said. “One thing I think College Park has
                struggled with over the years is that historically it’s been more of a commuter
                campus. People will live all around the area and commute to go to school, to go to
                class or to teach or do research, and then [they] disappear in the evening.”

                With this in mind, it is important to recognize the University of Maryland’s
                presence as it relates to the city’s progression. More than 40,000 students
                currently attend Maryland, according to the university’s division of research. Not
                only does this surplus of students play a role in the city’s approval of housing
                grants, but also when it comes to creating affordable housing.
                <!--Graph of College Park's population compared to similarly sized cities-->
                <br><br>
                The city is ranked eighth amongst cities in Maryland in terms of population size,
                but third from last in terms of median income, according to the United States
                Census Bureau.
                <br><br>
                Therefore, creating affordable housing for its residents is a project the city
                continues to prioritize.
                <br><br>
                “The city is always concerned to have affordable housing, housing for grad
                students, and housing for undergrad students,” said Michael Williams, the
                economic development manager for the city. “That’s always a priority for us.”

                More than 30,000 vehicles drive in or through College Park daily, according
                to the Maryland Department of Transportation.
                <br><br>
                Due in part to this volume, the city and county have attempted to alleviate
                congestion from cars.
                <br><br>
                To date, discussions in College Park involving commuting often center around
                environmentally friendly transportation and lowering carbon emissions.
                <br><br>
                City residents and local commuters now await an expansive railway transit that will
                check both of those boxes.
                <br><br>
                The Purple Line is an electronically sustainable, 16-mile light railway system that
                will connect more of the region&#39;s railways, while connecting more people to jobs.
                <br><br>
                In terms of economic and environmental impact, it is estimated to take 17,000
                cars off the road daily, ultimately saving one million gallons of gas within the next
                20 years, according to MDOT. The line is estimated to be completed by 2026.

                On a local level, College Park’s City Council has organized projects that hope to
                inspire less vehicular traffic too.
                <br><br>
                Daily construction on Baltimore Avenue, in College Park, is part of a two-phase plan
                which will bring new medians to separate lanes going in both directions, eliminate
                suicide lanes, add new pedestrian lighting, and implement other roadway changes.
                The project is set to be completed in the summer of 2023, according to MDOT. <!--Line graph of environmental impact of purple line (gallons of gas)-->
                <br><br>
                Another notable change, demanded by local residents for decades, includes the
                creation of a bike lane on Baltimore Avenue. This idea has been in the works since
                the 1980s, yet this is the first time the strip is painted on the roadway. <!--Live video of Baltimore Avenue's new painted bike lanes-->
                <br><br>
                This lane is also a part of the overall plan to alleviate car use in the city and instead
                incentivize more pedestrian and cyclist traffic.
                <br><br>
                “One of the goals that we have overall is to make it so that people don’t feel the
                need to use their cars as much,” said Wojahn. “So, putting more amenities within
                walking or biking distance, making it safer to walk and bike—those are all part of
                that strategy.”

            <h2>Infrastructure Capabilities and Population Forecasts</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left; width: 85%; margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 10px;">
                Something important to recognize given all of this is that College Park is urbanizing
                at a rapid rate. The mayor expects the population to leap another 5,000,
                from approximately 35,000 to 40,000 in the next five years.
                <br><br>
                For context, the population of the city was about 25,000 in 2007, when the
                mayor first joined the council. From 2007 to roughly five years from now, the city
                expects a 60 percent increase in population. <!--Timeline of College Park's population in recent years-->
                <br><br>
                That said, getting around College Park will not be the same.
                <br><br>
                The city may be in the process of creating new developments for transportation
                and adapting the infrastructure to fit people’s interests. Yet, a concern worth
                considering is whether the city will be able to add the residents and ensure a
                similar, or a better quality of life.
                <br><br>
                According to recent U.S. census findings, College Park is growing faster than
                approximately 72% of other similarly sized cities since the year 2000.
                <br><br>
                Here are a few cities in Maryland that are growing at a slower rate than College Park, but have similar populations:

                Recent data shows the city is one of the fastest growing cities in the state.
                <br>
                While the city, county, and state have worked years and years on
                transportation/infrastructure projects, construction of these projects across the
                city and state are still ways away from being completed. 
                <br><br>
                The two-phase roadway plan on Baltimore Avenue is still months from being finished, and the Purple Line is
                still years from completion.
                <br><br>
                Couple this with the incoming residents signing yearly leases in the multiple new
                housing developments, and the city will have no issues of people living in it year-

                <br><br>
                Instead, it may face new issues of too many people and too much activity, without
                sufficient infrastructure and public transit present to support its growing
                population.
